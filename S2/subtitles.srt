1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,841
(horns honking)

2
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,078
Sorry, little dudes,
we're gonna be here a while.

3
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:12,513
A truck broke down, and the cops
are taking their sweet time

4
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,148
clearing it up.

5
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:16,917
(laughing) He thinks
my tummy is a mountain.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,087
Lou, Lou, quick, take a selfie.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,988
It's not a selfie if I take it.

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,856
He's kissing me.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,925
Take a selfie! Take a selfie!

10
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,528
Oh, man, my phone's dead.

11
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,430
Milhouse, what am I missing
in the group text?

12
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,065
It's awesome.

13
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,334
You're never gonna get
caught up.

14
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,002
(Bart groans)

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,739
What kind of jazz you
listening to, stupid or boring?

16
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,674
It's Marc Maron's podcast.

17
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,178
He does cool interviews
with really interesting people.

18
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,180
Lame, lame, don't know him.

19
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:48,182
Lame, lame,
don't know her.

20
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:50,118
Loudon Wainwright, lame, lame.

21
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:53,887
(gasps)
This guy interviewed Krusty?

22
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:59,193
Yeah. Hey, no, aw,
that's my ear bu... Ew.

23
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:00,561
It's yours now.

24
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,231
MARC MARON:
Wow. That's incredible, Krusty.

25
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,032
I mean, really, I'm blown away.

26
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,968
Yeah, well, it's true.
It's absolutely true.

27
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,871
I have a phobia... of pies.

28
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,941
That's so crazy because,
I mean, we've all seen you get

29
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,043
hit in the face with pies
on your show.

30
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,313
No, no, no, those are cakes
decorated as pies.

31
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:23,151
Oh, right, so that's how you
make yourself feel safe.

32
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:26,220
It's not the crust;
it's the fillings.

33
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,055
Krusty, I got to ask you
about something,

34
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,224
and-and I don't want you
to get defensive,

35
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:32,226
but it's something
you've never talked about.

36
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,396
Can you tell me about
The Sands of Space?

37
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,166
Oh, no.
That's off-limits, soul patch!

38
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:40,268
We could talk about
the exploding milkshakes

39
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,435
in your Laffy Meals.

40
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,171
Did they ever find
those kids' noses?

41
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:46,274
Okay, okay, I'll tell you about
The Sands of Space,

42
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:50,178
the movie that almost
consumed my soul.

43
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,179
(electric can opener whirring)

44
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:53,113
-(cats mewling)
-Yeah, yeah, keep talking.

45
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,682
I'm just feeding the cats.

46
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:58,186
(loudly): It all began back in
the golden age of Hollywood,

47
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:02,490
the late 1980s,
when high concept was king.

48
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:05,293
You'd mix two kooky words
together in the title,

49
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:08,128
put a rap song at the end
that explains the plot,

50
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:12,666
and bam-- you're on the cover
of Premiere magazine.

51
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,603
I had starred in the hit
action buddy comedy

52
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,137
Good Cop, Dog Cop,

53
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:20,174
where I played
a murdered police officer

54
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,377
who is reincarnated as his
partner's pet Saint Bernard.

55
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:27,147
Five smashed squad cars,
100 exploded helicopters,

56
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,350
and the mayor's wife has fleas.

57
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,185
Turn in your badge
and your collar.

58
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,321
You're suspended for a month!

59
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,189
For me,
that's like seven months.

60
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,225
Dog Cop!

61
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,992
(grunting)

62
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,994
KRUSTY:
Suddenly, everyone in town

63
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,130
was dying to be
in the Krusty business,

64
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,166
and I was dipping shrimp
with all the big talents

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,136
I once longed to see fail.

66
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,573
And, of course, what the studio
wanted most was a sequel.

67
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,342
Okay, Krusty, we've got

68
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,878
Good Cop, Dog Cop 2:
Golden Revolver all lined up.

69
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,713
We, uh... who-who did the...

70
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:02,316
The two Terrys, they just
turned in a great script.

71
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,818
Savage Sam Borgberg
is all set to direct.

72
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,420
So when do we start?

73
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:09,056
I get it.
You think I'm just some hack,

74
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,260
out to churn out lazy sequels
for a quick buck.

75
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,495
Yes.

76
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,197
This is my next movie.

77
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,267
The Sands of Space?

78
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,501
Krusty, are you kidding me?

79
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,571
This is the most famously
un-filmable book in history.

80
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:27,408
It made Kubrick a recluse.
It-it drove Coppola to wine.

81
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,343
The four Jeffs tried
to write a script,

82
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,279
but even they couldn't crack it.

83
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:34,748
When I bought this at
an adult bookstore by mistake,

84
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,717
it changed my life.

85
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,287
"There's a light that shines
from star to star,

86
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,223
from soul to soul, connecting
everyone in the universe."

87
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,759
Wow.

88
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,562
It's not landing for me
that the hero doesn't

89
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:52,300
refuse the quest
before he accepts the quest.

90
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,534
Is that landing for you?

91
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,236
Look, I'm not drinking
out of one more toilet

92
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,306
until you green-light
this movie.

93
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,208
And I'm not playing
a dog, either. (grunts)

94
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,577
All right, we got a comic
who wants to make

95
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,246
a hippie-dippie
science-fiction vanity project.

96
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,284
Here's what we do: we humor him,
and we make it dirt cheap.

97
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,152
We could shoot it
in Mexico for nothing.

98
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,221
We hire a has-been to direct it

99
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,324
and never-wases
to do everything else.

100
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,993
After it bombs, that clown will
come scooting his butt back here

101
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:24,231
to make all the Dog Cop movies
we want. Two more.

102
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,266
KRUSTY:
The Sands of Space was a go,

103
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,069
and the studio hired
the least-qualified crew

104
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,639
they could find,
including a young couple

105
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,308
whose love was just
starting to bloom.

106
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,276
She was full of optimism,

107
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,580
and he was slightly less fat
than he was going to be.

108
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,114
What could be cooler?

109
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:44,685
You and me working on a movie
together all summer long

110
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,254
as production assistants.

111
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,323
It's so romantic.

112
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,659
We'll be like Elizabeth Taylor
and Richard Burton

113
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,261
if they had to get coffee
for everybody.

114
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,629
(both moaning)

115
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,030
(indistinct chatter)

116
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:01,034
All right, everyone,
saddle up for Juárez, Mexico.

117
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,704
That's where I shot
Manhattan Mix Up.

118
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,474
Lost a lot of good men
on that show.

119
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:09,109
Now, move it out!

And... action!

00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,742
So barren, so alien,

Cut. Cut it!

132
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:52,185
This sand is sand-colored.
It's supposed to be red.

133
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,555
So what? Sand is sand.

134
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,356
Did you even read the book?

These blood dunes
are all that's left of humanity

136
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,261
after the Rust Wars.

137
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,664
What's to read?
It's a space picture.

138
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,400
Laser cars,
girls with octopus arms,

139
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:09,102
zip zap glip glorp,
and it's in the can.

Look, you no-talent
bag of wrinkles.

Go back to whatever
Toluca Lake drunk tank

142
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,242
they fished you out of,

143
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:18,546
because you're not getting
anywhere near my movie!

144
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,514
(blows nose)

145
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,516
Sir, I've worked
in moving pictures

146
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,418
since they were
called "stillies."

147
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:27,354
I once shot a two-hour picture
in 90 minutes.

148
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,559
And so I say to you, in the
words of Miss Lillian Gish,

149
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,326
go crap in your hat.

150
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,932
And now, if you'll excuse me,

151
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:42,235
I am going to mysteriously drown
in the ocean.

152
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,976
As you may have heard, there's
been an amicable parting of ways

153
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,212
with that moron director.
We wish him well.

154
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,415
Clearly, there's only one artist
close enough to this film

155
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,552
-to direct it: me.
-(all gasp)

156
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,288
I know what you're thinking--
have I taken on too much

157
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,591
by starring
and directing a movie

158
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,159
that I was also tricked
into cofinancing?

159
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:09,663
No, because this story
must be told.

160
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,433
This is so exciting.

161
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:17,605
Krusty's got the passion and
vision to make this movie great.

162
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,607
(sobbing)

163
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,843
I have no idea
how to make a movie.

164
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:26,614
I know nothing.

165
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,082
All these people are screwed.

166
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,385
And the crew gift
is just a T-shirt.

167
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,191
Right, right, I-I get it.

168
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,493
In the tradition
of every actor ever,

169
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,129
-you thought you could direct.
-Directing seemed so easy.

170
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,932
You just hold your hands like
this, then bing, bang, boom,

171
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,700
Annie Leibovitz
is taking your portrait

172
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,435
in a bathtub full of milk.

173
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,204
(laughs) Yeah, talk about

174
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,340
Man, I remember once
I was filming a special

175
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,642

Now, let me talk.

179
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,651
KRUSTY:
They say in Hollywood,
"Nobody knows anything."

180
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:06,119
Well, I knew a lot less
than that.

181

-feathers or scales?
-I don't know, how about scales?

183
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,562
Oh, well, there goes
the whole costume budget.

184
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,829
Uh, for the crew lunch,

185
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,631
the grips want
their hot dogs boiled,

186
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,366
but the gaffers
want them grilled.

00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,502
Either way, I don't got no
hot dogs, so, uh, which is it?

188
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:25,138
Do you want the space ship doors
to open like,

189
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,542
"Zzztt-zzztt," "ppswishh"
or "wahh-wahh"?

00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,799
Why should I climb out of here
and have you?

347
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:36,069
Marge spends all her time
taking care of that needy clown.

348
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,571
I thought I was
her passion project.

349
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,940
You know, someday
you might appreciate a wife

350
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,842
who's developed
empathy and patience

351
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,112
for chubby, selfish men.

352
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,647
(laughs)
Look at that bald guy.

353
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,083
(laughs) He's so bald!

354
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,518
I don't think
we'll ever be born.

355
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,520
Sorry, Maggie.

356
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,488
Eat my thorns. (hums)

357
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,024
Why, you prickly...!

358
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,059
-(shouting angrily)
-(choking)

359
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,033
(panting)

360
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,637
A casa. I'm saved.

361
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,641
Ay, caramba!

362
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:19,979
The Pain Lords forced me to mine
every quarry on this planet,

363
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:24,417
but they never imagined
I had the Love Gem all along.

364
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:28,055
And... cut.

365
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,024
That was amazing.

366
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,959
And you remembered
all your lines.

367
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,295
Aw, thanks...

368
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,130
Marge.

369
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,999
You've helped me become
what every director should be:

370
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:43,070
an amiable guy
who makes everyone suffer

371
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,971
through his hellish process.

372
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,873
Homer's been kidnapped.

373
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:49,142
-(gasps)
-There's a note.

374
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,978
(speaking Spanish)

375
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,714
"We have taken
your blubbering coward."

376
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,749
(speaking Spanish)

377
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,056
"The ransom is $1 million

378
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,059
or 100 Los Angeles Raiders
season tickets."

379
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:09,028
-(speaking Spanish)
-"Go, Raiders."

380
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,064
Oh, geez, I'm sorry, everyone.

381
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:13,533
We don't have the cash
to ransom that kid,

382
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,568
but I think I know
what he'd want:

383
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,105
a special thanks
in the closing credits

384
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,541
right before which kind
of film stock we used.

385
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,875
Back to work.

386
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,179
No. This crew
looks after its own.

387
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,414
We're gonna save Homer,

388
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:31,251
and I don't care how much
golden time they have to pay us.

389
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,757
We don't have
a million-dollar ransom,

390
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,359
but we do have one thing:

391
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,128
movie magic.

392
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,230
Powder up, everyone.

393
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,566
(all shouting)

394
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,703
-(laughs)
- Ay, ay, ay! (speaks Spanish)

395
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,239
"Ay ay ay," indeed.

396
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,774
(crowd gasping)

397
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,943
Give us back our P.A.!

398
00:17:56,976 --> 00:18:00,547
The Americans, they have weapons
from the future.

399
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,316
Yar!

400
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,353
These weapons from the future,
they are not real.

401
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,192
(imitating laser gun firing)

402
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,894
(imitating laser gun firing)

403
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,263
(groans)

404
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:20,133
Stop shooting.
Stop shooting. Cut!

405
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:23,236
Okay, that's a five.

406
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,472
We don't have
your million dollars,

407
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:28,275
but we can give you something
much more valuable:

408
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,076
a Hollywood movie.

409
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,980
All we want back is the
lowliest member of our crew.

410
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,749
We could sell it to
the highest bidder at MIFED!

411
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,984
You have a deal.

412
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:41,588
No, no! You can't give away
my masterwork.

413
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,991
"There's a light that shines
from star to star,

414
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:49,262
from soul to soul, connecting
everyone in the universe."

415
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,931
Be the man who believes
in those words,

416
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,403
and let the light between me and
Homer give life to our universe.

417
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:02,242
Gentlemen, the film is yours.

418
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,617
You're a good man, Krusty.

419
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,385
Only when I'm with you,

420
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,888
which is why I never
want to see you again.

421
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,291
I want that, too.

422
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,993
I've done a lot of interviews,
man, but wow.

423
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:24,063
I-I am so glad
that Byron Allen canceled.

424
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,399
And after that,
my movie career was kaput.

425
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,401
I was sent back to kids TV

426
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:32,171
and never cared about making
anything good ever again.

427
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:35,242
Well, folks, you heard it.
Who could ever forget it?

428
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:39,579
A heartbreaking story about a
selfish man's one selfless act.

429
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,080
Do you like hot cashews

430
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,316
but don't have the time
to heat them up?

431
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,686
'ShewBlasters is disrupting
the heated nut business.

432
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,155
If the 'Shew heats, eat it!

433
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,258
(Krusty groans)

434
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,937
-BART: Mom! Dad!
-You guys never told us

435
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,205
you worked on a movie together.

436
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,674
So that's why
you've been wearing

437
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,509
that crew jacket
all these years.

438
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,445
That crazy movie? Oh, man,
that was a long time ago.

439
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,946
We were just kids.

440
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,181
What was it like?

441
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,916
Well, working on that movie set

442
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,252
turned out to be
a lot like our marriage.

443
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:22,355
Long days, stupid fights
you don't remember,

444
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,357
but damn good breakfasts.

445
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,193
A good breakfast
can get you through a lot.

446
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,363
But what happened to the movie?
Did Krusty ever see it?

447
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,299
I don't know.
I guess we'll never know.

448
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,366
(light buzzing)

449
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,436
The love crystal
is whole once more.

450
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:40,907
The prophecy is fulfilled.

451
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,285
(laughter)

452
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,588
-What? Why are they laughing?
-They think it's a comedy.

453
00:20:55,622 --> 00:21:00,159
(groans) It was supposed to show
how we're all connected.

454
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:04,464
Look around, man.
Maybe it did, maybe it did.

455
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,600
If you think this is closure,
you're nuts.

456
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,492
CREW GUY:
Wahh-wahh.
